I really missed your last class.  The microprocessor stuff comes
easily to me, this timing stuff I am having a much harder time with.
I think that means i have more to learn here.

So here is the current problem which I am struggling with.
if you type
./run
Then at time 705 (first column), nBUSRQ (second to last column) goes negative.
at time 745 nBUSAK goes negative (last Column)

  TIME   ADDR DQ ACC    PC  IR SUM nBUSRQ nBUSAK
   705    18   z    9     9 119   9     0     1
   715     9   z    9     9 119   9     0     1
   725     9 118    9     9 119   9     0     1
   735     9   z    9    10 118   9     0     1
   745     9   z    9    10 118   9     0     1
ADDRESS     z ADDR=   10 DQ= 111
ADDRESS   170 ADDR=    X DQ= 111
   755     X 111    9    10 118   9     0     0

Then in file bus.v I set the address and data, and display them.

always @(negedge nBUSAK)
  begin
     data    <=  8'd111;     
     #5 address <= 16'd170;
     #10 $display ("ADDRESS ", address, " ADDR=", ADDR, " DQ= ", DQ);
     #15 $display ("ADDRESS ", address, " ADDR=", ADDR, " DQ= ", DQ);             
  end

   assign ADDR = address;
   assign DQ = data;

Bus as you can see the ADDR goes to X.
What am I doing wrong?
